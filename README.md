# 💫 About Me:
I am a bachelor’s student at Liberty University studying Information Technology with a specialization in Data Networking & Security, complemented by a Minor in Pre-Law. My academic focus sits at the intersection of infrastructure, security, and governance—how systems are designed, protected, and responsibly deployed in high-stakes environments.
<br><br>My passion for technology started early. At age 12, I built my first computer under the guidance of a mentor, an experience that sparked a lasting interest in how systems work at both the hardware and network levels. Since then, I’ve gravitated toward complex, mission-critical problems where reliability, security, and clarity matter more than convenience.
<br><br>That trajectory led me deep into Civil Air Patrol (CAP) emergency services and software development, where I’ve contributed to and led several large-scale operational and technical initiatives:
<br><br>Training & Doctrine Development: Designed and implemented Search & Rescue (SAR) and Disaster Response training curricula used to prepare teams for real-world emergency operations.
<br><br>TAK Ecosystem Integration: Built specialized workflows and data pipelines for Team Awareness Kit (TAK), enabling ingestion of external data sources such as Esri Survey123 and other geospatial platforms.
<br><br>VISTA Platform: In response to the sunset of DAART, I architected VISTA (Visual Information Streaming for Tactical Analysis)—a modular, self-contained situational awareness system built from existing field kits and custom tooling.
<br><br>TACTIC Server: Designed TACTIC (Tactical Autonomous Command and Tracking Interface Controller), an offline-first mission management server that runs entirely on local hardware, eliminating reliance on internet or cloud services for operational command and control.
<br><br>Across these projects, my work emphasizes offline resilience, secure communications, data integrity, and operator usability—principles that also guide my academic and professional goals. I am especially interested in roles involving network engineering, security architecture, mission systems, and government or defense-adjacent infrastructure, where technical decisions have real operational and ethical consequences.
